# MySQL
### MySql and Python for Database Design Course

This repository contains my ER-Diagrams, relationship schemas, MySQL queries, and Python code. Two databases are used for this repository.
The first is called toyuniversity and the second clystms (renamed c4333f16) for later projects.

While these are class assignments, I have chosen to upload my version of the solutions only after they have been graded and my professor 
has uploaded his solutions to his website. 

The file toyuniversity.sql builds the toyuniversity database that is used for certain queries. The file toyuniversity-queries.sql is a
series of queries run against it for an early assignment.

I have two .erd files that show my ER diragrams for a Swim Team Management System. Ultimately, the relationship schema was created using my professor's ER diagram and my actual clystms.sql file was created using my professor's solution for the relationship schema.

The file clystms-queries.sql is a series of queries run against the clystms database.

I will soon add files that are focused on writing Python scripts to query and manipulate MySQL databases.
