# MySQL
### MySql and Python for Database Design Course

This repository contains my ER-Diagrams, relationship schemas, MySQL queries, and Python code. Two databases are used for this repository.
The first is called toyuniversity and the second clystms (renamed c4333f16) for later projects.

While these are class assignments, I have chosen to upload my version of the solutions only after they have been graded and my professor 
has uploaded his solutions to his website. 

The file toyuniversity.sql builds the toyuniversity database that is used for certain queries.
